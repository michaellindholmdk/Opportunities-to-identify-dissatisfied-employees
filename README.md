# Opportunities-to-identify-dissatisfied-employees

In this project, I have the role of a data analyst. Our stakeholders want to know the following:

1. Are employees who only worked for the institutes (as desribed in the project file) for a short period of time, resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?   
2. Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?   

To answer these questions I will combine, clean and analyse data from employees at the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.

The most important findings from this analysis:

1. For short termed employements, less than a third are dissatisfied when resigning their job. However, more than half of the veteran employees are dissatisfied when resigning.   
2. Resignation due to some kind of dissatisfaction is not age dependent.   

Based on the results it is recommended that the stakeholders should focus on identifying opportuntities to improve the job satisfaction for experienced and veteran employees in order to retain useful experience within the institutes.
